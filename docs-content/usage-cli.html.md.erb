title: Using the Stark & Wayne SHIELD™ CLI
---

The primary method for configuring SHIELD is the `shield` CLI.

## <a id="installation"></a>Installation

On Ubuntu/Debian machines, such as the Ops Manager VM, you can install the `shield` CLI using `apt-get`:

```
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starkandwayne/homebrew-cf/master/public.key | apt-key add -
echo "deb http://apt.starkandwayne.com stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/starkandwayne.list
apt-get update

apt-get install shield
```

On MacOS/OS X machines, you can install the `shield` CLI using our Homebrew tap:

```
brew tap starkandwayne/cf
brew install starkandwayne/cf/shield
```

##<a id="help"></a> Help

The `shield` CLI is well documented and offers a detailed description of all available commands.

  "endpoint": "{\"endpoint\":\"schmendpoint\"}",
  "agent": "127.0.0.1:1234"
}
```

##<a id="installation"></a> Targeting your SHIELD installation

To interact with your deployed SHIELD via the CLI first we must target the SHIELD Daemon API endpoint that was deployed when you provisioned Stark & Wayne SHIELD.

With respect to the `shield` CLI, the targeted SHIELD daemon API is called a "backend".

The URL for your SHIELD Daemon is `https://shield.[system domain]`.

```
$ shield create-backend prod https://shield.system.pcf110.starkandwayne.com
Successfully created backend 'prod', pointing to 'https://shield.system.pcf110.starkandwayne.com'

Using https://shield.system.pcf110.starkandwayne.com (prod) as SHIELD backend
```

Next you will need to provide credentials to the targeted SHIELD daemon API:

```
$ shield status -k
Authentication Required

User: admin

Password: [password]
```

Find the SHIELD credentials in Ops Manager:

The `-k` flag must be used when interacting with your SHIELD Daemon API if it has a self-signed SSL certificates.

##

##<a id="create-entries"></a> Creating entities

In order to set up a regularly running job in SHIELD you must create a number of entities:

- schedule
- retention-policy
- store
- target
- job

Each of these entities can be created interactively via the CLI by answering the questions presented.

For example, to create a new retention policy:

```
$ shield create-policy -k
Policy Name: daily
Summary:
Retention Timeframe, in days: 10


Policy Name:                  daily
Summary:
Retention Timeframe, in days: 10


Really create this retention policy? [y/n] y

Created new retention policy
Name:       daily
Summary:
Expiration: 10 days
```

For the store and target entities a plugin and its configuration must be specified. The plugin configuration must be valid JSON:

```
$ shield create-target -k
Target Name: A Postgres DB
Summary:
Plugin Name: postgres
Configuration: {"pg_host":"127.0.0.1","pg_password":"[password]","pg_port":"5432","pg_user":"vcap"}
Remote IP:port: 10.0.1.2:5444


Target Name:    a-pg-db
Summary:        Some PostgreSQL DB
Plugin Name:    postgres
Configuration:  {"pg_host":"127.0.0.1","pg_password":"[password]","pg_port":"5432","pg_user":"vcap"}
Remote IP:port: 10.0.1.2:5444


Really create this target? [y/n] y

Created new target
Name:          a-pg-db
Summary:       Some PostgreSQL DB

Plugin:        postgres
Configuration: {"pg_host":"127.0.0.1","pg_password":"[password]","pg_port":"5432","pg_user":"vcap"}
Remote IP:     10.0.1.2:5444
```

Notice that the `pg_host` is set to `127.0.0.1` in the plugin configuration and the `Remote Ip` is set to `10.0.1.2:5444`. In this case it is assumed that the SHIELD Agent performing the backup is colocated on the same VM as the PostgreSQL database. The Agent is listening on `10.0.1.2:5444` and the database will be reachable via localhost on that VM. When the backup is run the SHIELD Daemon will contact the remotely running Agent and pass the configuration which will be used to execute the plugin.

##<a id="setting-up-a-jobs"></a> Setting up a job

Once all of the entities have been created the job combines everything into a task that the Daemon will perform:

```
$ shield create-job -k
Job Name: db-backup
Summary:
Store: default
Target: a-pg-db
Retention Policy: default
Schedule: daily
Paused? (no):

Job Name:         db-backup
Summary:
Store:            default (f2f926c9-4b02-405a-b92e-b5ebed4963f3)
Target:           a-pg-db (81a362ea-4272-4d61-bb36-745445419456)
Retention Policy: default (2d474753-22f1-461c-a9c5-8ca37916ea03)
Schedule:         daily (2f8ccadb-58cd-458d-8992-1cfa226ddba8)
Paused?:          false


Really create this backup job? [y/n] y

Created new job
Name:             db-backup
Paused:           N

Retention Policy: default
Expires in:       10 days

Schedule Policy:  daily

Target:           postgres
Target Endpoint:  {"pg_host":"127.0.0.1","pg_password":"[password]","pg_port":"5432","pg_user":"vcap"}
Remote IP:        10.0.1.2:5444

Store:            default
Store Endpoint:   {"bucket":"backups"}

Notes:
```

The job will be run at the time specified in the schedule. It can also be triggered manually from the CLI via:

```
$ shield run -k db-backup
Scheduled immediate run of job

##<a id="scripting"></a> Scripting

The `shield` CLI is easy to use in scripts by adding the `--raw` flag. This will make the CLI accept JSON formatted configuration piped from Stdin and output configuration via JSON so that it can be further used by other tools.

```
$ echo '{"endpoint":"{\"bucket\":\"backups\"}","name":"default","plugin":"google"}' | \
> shield --raw create-store -k
{"uuid":"71aac644-ad3f-4a9c-91e6-da4fd9e4815d","name":"default","summary":"","plugin":"google","endpoint":"{\"bucket\":\"backups\"}"}
```
