Stark & Wayne SHIELD is a standalone system that can perform backup and restore functions for a wide variety of pluggable data systems 
(like Redis, PostgreSQL, MySQL, RabbitMQ, etc.), storing backup data in pluggable storage solutions (i.e. local files, S3 blobstore, etc.).
SHIELD enables self-service for end users to perform ad hoc backup and restore operations, review backup schedules, retention policies and backup job runs, etc.
